Trouble with using yard-extensions outside of Mattock or when Mattock is Gemfiled in with :path - suspect that there's trouble crossing the Proxy boudary somehow?

Consider adding a "guess" for Configurable (c.f. Corundum's Git tasklib guessing branch)

Bug: SSH commands hang if they need a password...  stdin handling?
Bug: BundleCommandTask needs a needed? method - Gemfile younger than Gemfile.lock or files in gem directories

Feature: Tasklibs with a "default_sublib" setting - delete entries you don't want and replace?
(Only if documented and easy to discover...  maybe printed on Rake#verbose...)

Feature: Unpack task - depends on target files, so skipped until archive newer

Feature: CommandLine - streaming output - connect stdout/stderr to parent's
