Bug: Default values-by-reference (Hash, Array, ...) are reused.

Trouble with using yard-extensions outside of Mattock or when Mattock is Gemfiled in with :path - suspect that there's trouble crossing the Proxy boudary somehow?

Consider adding a "guess" for Configurable (c.f. Corundum's Git tasklib guessing branch)

Bug: SSH commands hang if they need a password...  stdin handling?
Bug: BundleCommandTask needs a needed? method - Gemfile younger than Gemfile.lock or files in gem directories

Feature: Consider updating cascading configurable: copy_settings_to is such a
default now, so breaking out a "copy them" as a default might be useful...
  - default impl of #default_configuration could be:
    args.each copy_settings_to(self); @cascades_from = args; prepare_configuration()
    (prepare is the skeleton method)
  - one other thing would be to do a #get_settings_from(other)
    so that you could override from copy_ to proxy_

Design decision: explicitly not making proxy_ the default. Can be much more
flexible, but because a dynamic behavior, it can be more confusing

Feature: ENV triggered config debug mode, where every value set, copy, or proxy
is logged

Feature: Tasklibs with a "default_sublib" setting - delete entries you don't want and replace?
(Only if documented and easy to discover...  maybe printed on Rake#verbose...) Used as a skeleton for things like Corundum where there are 5+ normal Tasklibs in use

Feature: Unpack task - depends on target files, so skipped until archive newer

Feature: CommandLine - streaming output - connect stdout/stderr to parent's

DirectoryStructure and Valise are related - would be nice e.g. to use a Valise as the "root" for a DirStrct and populate files that way
